### Projects

Here are some of my interesting repositories:

1. [Tetris Game](https://github.com/d-lehel/tetris-android-game): A classic Tetris game developed for Android using Kotlin programming language. Play the game and test your puzzle-solving skills!

2. [Snake Game](https://github.com/d-lehel/snake-android-game): Experience the nostalgia of the Snake game on your Android device. Control the snake, eat food, and avoid obstacles in this addictive arcade game.

3. [Snake AI](https://github.com/d-lehel/snakeAI-genetic-algorithm): This project implements a Snake game using Pygame library and incorporates a neural network and genetic algorithm to train an AI agent to play the game.

4. [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/d-lehel/msc-sudoku-solver-genetic-algorithm): An Android Kotlin app that solves Sudoku puzzles using a genetic algorithm. It intelligently finds the solution to the puzzle by applying genetic algorithm techniques.

5. [Traveling Salesman](https://github.com/d-lehel/msc-project-traveling-salesman): This project is a visualization using p5.js that demonstrates the solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem. It implements algorithms like the nearest neighbor and 2-opt algorithm to optimize the route.

Feel free to explore these repositories and check out the code. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me.
